## Easy wallpaper

- John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

- John knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The length of a roll is `10` meters. He bears in mind however, that it’s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

- Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

Task:

- Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

Example:
`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"`
`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"`

Notes:

- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge

- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that w _ h _ l is zero

- the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)

In Coffeescript, Javascript, Python, Ruby and Scala the English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:
`numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"]`

- For other languages it is not preloaded and you can instead copy the above list if you desire.

Solution:

```js
function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
  let a = 2 * w * h + 2 * l * h;
  return l && w ? numbers[Math.ceil((a * 1.15) / (10 * 0.52))] : numbers[0];
}
console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29)); // sixteen
console.log(wallpaper(7.8, 2.9, 3.29)); // sixteen
console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 5.8, 3.13)); // seventeen
```
