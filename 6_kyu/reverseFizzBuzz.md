## [FizzBuzz Backwards](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ad13d5589d2a1d84000020/)

- Traditionally in FizzBuzz, multiples of 3 are replaced by "Fizz" and multiples of 5 are replaced by "Buzz". But we could also play FizzBuzz with any other integer pair `[n, m]` whose multiples are replaced with Fizz and Buzz.

- For a sequence of numbers, Fizzes, Buzzes and FizzBuzzes, find the numbers whose multiples are being replaced by Fizz and Buzz. Return them as an array `[n, m]`

- The Fizz and Buzz numbers will always be integers between 1 and 50, and the sequence will have a maximum length of 100. The Fizz and Buzz numbers might be equal, and might be equal to 1.



##### Examples:

- Classic FizzBuzz; multiples of 3 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 5 are replaced by Buzz:

`[1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 6]  ==>  [3, 5] `

- Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 3 are replaced by Buzz:

`[1, "Fizz", "Buzz", "Fizz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [2, 3]`

- Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz and Buzz:

`[1, "FizzBuzz", 3, "FizzBuzz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [2, 2]`

- Fizz = 1, Buzz = 6:

`["Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "FizzBuzz"]  ==>  [1, 6]`

#### Solution:

```js
function reverseFizzBuzz(array) {
  let fizz = array.indexOf("Fizz") + 1
  let buzz = array.indexOf("Buzz") + 1
  
  if(fizz === 0){
    fizz = array.indexOf("FizzBuzz") + 1
  } if (buzz === 0){
    buzz = array.indexOf("FizzBuzz") + 1
  }
  return [fizz, buzz]
};

console.log(reverseFizzBuzz([1,2,"Fizz",4,"Buzz"])); // [3,5]
console.log(reverseFizzBuzz([1,"Fizz","Buzz","Fizz",5,"FizzBuzz"])); // [2,3]
console.log(reverseFizzBuzz([1,"FizzBuzz",3,"FizzBuzz",5,"FizzBuzz"])); // [2,2]
```
